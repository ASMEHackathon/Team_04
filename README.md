# Deep Learning Based Meltpool Prediciton
This project is for predict the meltpool from the given XYPT data by using deep leanring based method. This project includes two sections. In first section, we propose a hybrid model to predict the meltpool size. In second section, we explore the way to generate MPM co-axis image by using a generative network.
## 1. Meltpool size prediction by using physics information infused LSTM model

## 2. Meltpool co-axis image generation by using MPMGAN
